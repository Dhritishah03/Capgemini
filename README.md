# Capgemini
Collaborated with Capgemini, working alongside a company mentor on fall and foul detection using machine learning.
So it focuses on object detection and pose estimation using yolo where we can detect the fall. We used many models like VG16, CNN, ResNet, EfficientNetB0. I worked on the yolo part as well as developed the EfficientNetB0 Model which achieved a test accuracy of 98%. The RestNet model achieved an accuracy of 96% on the test case. We are using Event detection for real time match analysis. So currently we have started working on the publication and writing a research paper on the same.
